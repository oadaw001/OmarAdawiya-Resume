        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello! My name is Omar Adawiya. I am currently a Sophomore at the University of California Riverside. My major is Business Economics. I chose Business Economics as Iâ€™ve always had a passion for pursuing Economics from when I was in high school. Taking economics classes as well as math, I found myself always interested in graphs and trends of a business. This passion followed as I went into university and found out how much more I love math and the economics classes I was taking. This was what led me to pursue a career in economics.<br><br>
        During my high school career Iâ€™ve had an internship at a hotel where I was working in different parts of it such as the front desk, food and beverage, finance, and even customer relations. I was able to see the behind the scenes of how a hotel operates. I got to see what goes into building a successful hotel from the business and personal aspect of it. In the finance department, I was shown how much money was coming in daily to the company. Although it was a hotel the company that owned the hotel had also owned restaurants. This meant I was able to also see what money was being spent and what money the company was bringing in to run the business. I have also worked in a tire company where I was able to understand the ins and outs of the tire business. I did not expect a tire company to be so intricate with the types of tires and the different companies that bring in the tires and how each tire that comes in must be counted to the exact amount as written in the different contracts. Another part of my life that I felt helped me alot in putting myself out there was joining the debate team during my senior year of high school. Iâ€™ve always been someone who had a hard time with public speaking. Throughout my time at the debate team I was able to practice my public speaking skills as well as skills that would help me with general debates I might have during the course of my career. It enhanced alot of other skills I did not expect such as the way I began to speak to people around mechanged. I felt like I had become a more social person overall.<br><br>


        All in all, the experiences I went through helped shape who I am as a person today. I felt like no matter where I worked or what experiences I went through each and every step of the process I learned something new. I plan on continuing to grow my portfolio and continue to find things that help me gain new skills. I am still a sophomore who plans on doing many things throughout the three years I have left in university. Although sometimes things might now go the way I would like them to, everything I have done has had some sort of impact on me whether positive or negative.
